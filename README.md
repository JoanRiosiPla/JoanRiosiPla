Hi there! I'm Joan, and I love coding and being creative. I'm currently studying in my last year of high school, but I have learnt how to code on my own.

I can code in:
- C++
- Python (Flask)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I'm also learning React and Node.
- Not related, but I love pixel art, and I'm learning to draw "properly".

Please, check out some of my cool projects ðŸ¥º:
- Scratch games
- Communopoly
- Beneit.cat
- Scratching The Surface
TODO: Add links :)
